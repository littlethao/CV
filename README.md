## Profile

I left a well-established career and joined Makers Academy to acquire software development skills to pursue a complete career change into tech, convinced that it will allow me to work in a creative industry where I'm learning every day.

I am most passionate about education, social development, travel and healthcare as well as getting involved in creative things that make people smile.

In my free time, I enjoy getting involved with open-source communities and meetup groups such as [Women Hack for Non-Profits (WHFNP)](http://www.womenhackfornonprofits.com/about.html) or [Women Who Code](https://www.womenwhocode.com/london), and I had a great experience volunteering as Coach at the [Rails Girls London](http://railsgirls.com/london.html) event in 2017
