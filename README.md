## Profile

I left a well-established career and joined Makers Academy to acquire software development skills to pursue a complete career change in to tech, convinced that it will allow me to work in a creative industry where I'm learning every day.

## Personal Attributes

#### Curious learner & mentor

Always on a hunt for pursuing new knowledge, I always wonder how things work and plunge into new areas around my tasks, asking questions and trying out new things. My curiosity in understanding the broader picture around my work got me involved in the training of several new aspects of business operations and eventually I took over more operational procedures on site in Mauritius.

As I was promoted to Senior to overlook the Swiss operational team on site, I saw it as an opportunity to create more mentoring opportunities to share knowledge within the whole team, which then improved the team performance by + 0.6 points within 4 months.

#### Detail-oriented problem solver

Whilst assisting the Signal Management Service Team at the European Medicines Agency, I managed and maintained the team's procedures on various databases and systems. I spotted that the current database did not cover the edge cases of our procedures, which lead to incorrect timelines being recorded. This also lead to incorrect data being forwarded to Committee members in other EU countries, which in turn leads to delay of task distribution. I came up with various steps that can be taken to resolve this issue, presented these to our Data Management and Technology Services teams. We were then able to rule out the best solution and implemented the changes shortly after.

#### Organised team player & individualist

Every role in my professional experience required me to be well organised, adaptable to change and whilst being flexible to respond to the multiple tasks and team members on often strict timelines, they also needed me to be capable to work independently and under little guidance. Feedback from my colleagues and line managers have always been that they were able to rely on me to ensure that procedures are being kept in line with the given procedural guidelines, regulations and timelines.

#### Languages

- German (born and bred in Germany)
- Vietnamese (upbringing with good mixture of Vietnamese culture and family values)
- English (main language in daily and professional practice since 2006)
- French (CEFR A2.1 Certificate - lived and worked in Mauritius for 4 years)
- Italian (basic level/high school module - comes in handy for travelling in Italy)
