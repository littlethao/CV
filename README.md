## Profile

I'm a former all-round Office Assistant, whose thirst for knowledge and whose curiosity has driven her beyond the User Interface to acquire the skills to venture into a new career as Junior Full Stack Developer.

Besides fulfilling my responsibilities as full-time professional, I enjoyed running German classes and writing newsletter articles during my time at VWR, organised team challenges at the Hilton Hotels & Resorts, acted as Event Photographer for the Young Barristers' Committee (YBC) in Mauritius, and been actively involved in Cultural & Social events in Germany.

I value:
an organisation that takes pride in its work and its people,
an organisation that is innovative and leads its people to grow professionally and personally with it,
an organisation that understands that by providing a fun working and learning environment most often leads to great achievements,
a team that loves learning by sharing,
a team that lefts no man behind,
a team that is passionate about their work and aiming to create things that matters to people.


## Personal Attributes

#### Good Listener

Practicing active listening always lead me to a better understanding of customers
and team members I have been dealing with.

- As a Guest Relations Officer at the Hilton Hotels & Resorts in Mauritius, my mission
was to ensure each guest is having a smooth and memorable stay with us. When issues
occur, most importantly it was to listen to understand the guests' trouble and needs.
The next steps then were to come up with a solution, follow-through till the issue is resolved and checking in on the guests to confirm they are happy with the outcome.  
- My promotion at VWR to a Senior Associate involved in leading a team of five diverse team members with different work motivation. Since the definition of "team" and "teamwork" does not come lightly to me, I was keen to get to know each team member
and their motivation in order to create a strong and positive team.
- Achievements: Awarded as the “best Team Member of the month of April 2012” (Front of the House) at the Hilton Mauritius Resort & SPA. / Increase of team performance
as per KPI points set by VWR Management.

#### Quality driven & Learning driven

I am a natural-born perfectionist who calls a job well done, when it meets a zero-error
standard (or beyond if time allows), can be easily followed-through and can be taken over with little instructions. My longing for learning is the good balance, when things do not go perfectly according to plan A. It then serves well as an opportunity to learn, resolve problems in order to deliver the best result at the time.

- My main task when joining VWR as Quotation Associate was in dealing with quotations from customers for the Sales Organisation in Switzerland. Once I settled and understood the task and SAP procedures, I felt that the procedures taken care of by our team could be improved based on customer feedback and KPI performance. During spare times, I looked more in-depth into SAP procedures and tried to understand the broader picture of our Organisation's processes and procedures. Further on, I got involved in more tasks and took care of documentation of procedures and training of team members.
- Achievement: Promoted as Senior Associate to lead the team on Switzerland Operations. / In preparation for the ISO9001 QMS, the Management Team selected me as one of their Quality Assurance Representatives.

#### Problem-solver

I can say from life experience that a problem does not resolve itself by looking away, but facing it. This most of the time involves analysing the issue/situation objectively, understanding the "how?", looking at it from different angles to see options to lead out from it, then taking the courage to make a decision and the courage to act upon it.

- Whilst assisting the Signal Management Service Team at the European Medicines Agency, I managed and maintained the team's procedures on various databases and systems. I spotted that the current database did not cover the edge cases of our procedures, hence did not record it with the correct timelines and dates. This also lead to incorrect data being forwarded to Committee members in other EU countries, which in turn leads to delay of task distribution. I came up with various steps that can be taken to resolve this issue, presented these to our Data Management and IT teams. We were then able to rule out the best solution and implemented the changes shortly after.  
- Achievements: During my time at the European Medicines Agency and at VWR, I continuously have been involved in processes to improve performance and procedures, which have been taken over by the teams.

#### Languages

- German (born and bred in Germany)
- Vietnamese (upbringing with good mixture of Vietnamese culture and family values)
- English (main language in daily and professional practice since 2006)
- French (CEFR A2.1 Certificate - lived and worked in Mauritius for 4 years)
